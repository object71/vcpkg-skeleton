## Usage
```cmake
vcpkg_copy_pdbs([BUILD_PATHS <${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/bin/*.dll> ...])
```

## Notes
This command should always be called by portfiles after they have finished rearranging the binary output.

## Parameters
### BUILD_PATHS
Path patterns passed to `file(GLOB_RECURSE)` for locating dlls.

Defaults to `${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/bin/*.dll` and `${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/debug/bin/*.dll`.
